Summary:
	
	It’s no secret that rent prices have been skyrocketing as of lately, and many may pose the question as to “why”? We chose to investigate a specific factor that may contribute to the increased cost of living, crime rates. 
  
  By gathering, cleaning, and merging relevant datasets from various sources, as well as ruuning multivariate linear regression analyses in Python Jupyter Notebooks, this report seeks to address the impact of crimes per capita on the average rental prices across 51 major US cities over a time span of 11 years, from 2005 to 2015.
